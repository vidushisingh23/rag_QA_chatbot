# RAG-QA Chatbot (Offline)

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** using Hugging Face models. The chatbot is capable of answering user queries based on uploaded documents (e.g., PDFs, text files) by retrieving the most relevant context and generating natural language answers .

### Project Context 

-  **Offline-first** design — no API keys or internet required
-  **Fully local** using Hugging Face transformer models and FAISS
-  **Lightweight and modular**, designed for secure and low-resource environments
-  **Streamlit-based UI** for an interactive and user-friendly experience
-  Ideal for personal, academic, or enterprise-level document Q&A systems
